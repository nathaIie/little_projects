Welcome to the **little spark projects** repo!:) This collection houses small academic and personal projects, each leveraging PySpark for data exploration using f.e. SQL-like commands and simple machine learning tasks such as classification.

## Project descriptions

### 1. Exploratory data analysis - MovieLens
- **File:** `eda_movielens.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook provides a brief introduction to the world of Big Data along with an overview of SQL-like commands. It conducts a simple exploratory data analysis on the dataset sourced from the [MovieLens Project](https://movielens.org/). Additional information about the dataset is available [here](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small-README.html).

### 2. LLM Ninja - NLP
- **File:** `llm_ninja.ipynb`
- **Description:** In this notebook I explore **V2 release of the DAIGT train dataset** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-v2-train-dataset) and search for the unique characteristics of LLM-generated texts.

## Data
All utilized datasets in the notebooks are stored in the `data` folder within this repository.
